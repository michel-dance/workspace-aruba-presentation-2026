## Talos Train Automation

### The rail road big picture

The main concerns and pain points of freigh railroads are:
* Safety - trains can brake, trains carry hazardous materials
* Fuel consumpution - this is their biggest cost
* Aging operator fleet - fewer younger people operating trains, not just in rail but a trend in mining and construction as well.
* Fleet maintenance - machines need upkeep

### The solution

Caterpillar is position itself as the leading provider of construction,
manufacturing, and mining automated solution. 

Caterpillar is investing heavily on digital transformation and adopting an AI first culture.

Our group takes on this challenge by providing automated train handling for freight and mining rail operations in the USA, and Australia, with the goal of capturing all of the north america market, and also entering the Brazil and Middle East markets

Our group builds the Talos Train Automation software that allows the engineer to engage the automation to handle the train with better fuel effiency and train handling.

### The Talos product installed on a BNSF locomotive.

BNSF owns locomotives from various manufactuers including ProgressRail.

We sell Talos in a hardware component box with multiple product slots where we include products purchased by the railroad.

Here is an example of the event-recorder product box: event-recorder-box.jpeg . This is a one box one product solution, so not as versatile as our Talos box with multiple expansion slots.
